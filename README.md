Hi and welcome!

My name is Vasiliy Kharitonov (Vasilii works as well) and this is my personal blog,
where I share updates on what I do and think. I have quite strong IT background
and I am more hands-on person than a manager or phylosopher, so most of my posts
are IT-related.

You can use links below to find read recent posts.
