IT is both my job and passion. During the work hours I make decisions on system
architecture and devise solutions on complex problems. During my free time I
tinker with hardware/software, e.g. program an ML model with PyTorch or build
an enterprise-grade server from scratch.

IT is my career since my first job. I have experience in web-design, iOS
development, system administration (both hardware and software), enterprise
software development and implementation, support service.

At the moment I am mostly working in SAP, with focus on SAP EWM and SAP ERP. I
am also interested in server software development with micro-services and
Full-Stack web-application development.
