I would like to announce SAP.how podcast. The plan is to have one video around hour long each week where I and
another person (probably different guests) discuss various news and interesting topics regarding
anything related to SAP.

The topics will be gathered in [SAP.how Telegram supergroup](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAELp3l6QtC28MD8w0A),
if you would like us to discuss something, you can post your suggestions there.

## Goals

First videos will be published only on YouTube (filmed offline), but I would like to set the following
goals for this podcast:

1. It should eventually become a live podcast with live streaming on YouTube and Twitch.
2. Audio version of the podcast should be available on iTunes and other podcast providers.

## Why

There are 2 main reasons for this podcast:

1. Promote [SAP.how](https://sap.how) on other platforms (mainly YouTube, possibly Twitch and iTunes).
2. Create more SAP.how content aside from our usual articles. I personally think that thematic podcasts
   will be interesting in SAP community.

## Format

I plan the following format:

- *Live* video feed. Live here means unmoderated, with all mistakes and pauses. This will allow later to do it
  live for real.
- Video is split horisontally in 2 parts: my facecam and facecam for a guest. Sometimes I will switch to
  screenshare to show what we are currently discussing (e.g. SAP webpage with release notes).
- Less than hour long. The podcast should end as soon as we are out of topics to discuss or at one hour
  mark, whatever comes earlier.
