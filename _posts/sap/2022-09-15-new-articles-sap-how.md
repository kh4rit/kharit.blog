I published a couple of new articles on [SAP.how](https://sap.how).

These are _problem -> solution_ articles, a little different from what I usually do.
However, I hope people will find them helpful.

You can find them following the links below:
- [No LOBM batch characteristics in S/4HANA](https://sap.how/s4hana/ewm/no-lobm-characteristic-s4hana)
- [UKMS technical settings are not maintainable without a transport request](https://sap.how/s4hana/UKMS-techical-settings-are-not-maintanable-without-transport)
