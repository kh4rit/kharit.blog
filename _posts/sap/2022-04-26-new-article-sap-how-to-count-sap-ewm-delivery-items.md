I wrote a new article on [SAP.how](https://sap.how) with information on how to
count SAP EWM delivery items in an existing system.

> If we already have a system (the old decentral EWM or S/4HANA is already
> used), how to calculate this metric? Should we count only main items, should
> we count text or zero items, should we count PMR/EGR items, â€” it is not clear
> from SAP documentation.
