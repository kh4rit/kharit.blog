Let me guess: you were searching for hours trying to figure out how to install Mu4e on macOS. I feel your pain. And you came to the right place. I will try to provide here a complete guide for macOS High Sierra or Mojave on **how to install Emacs Mu4e on Mac OS X systems.**

Here I am describing how to make it work with Gmail, but with small changes you can make it work with other mail providers.

## Install Homebrew

First of all we need Homebrew. You probably already have it but if you don't, there is a simple command to get it. Copy the following and paste it to the terminal.

``` bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

If you already have Homebrew, just execute the following commands to be sure that we are up to date.

``` bash
brew update
brew upgrade
```

## Install Emacs

Then of course we need emacs. You can use built-in version in macOS, but it is pretty old, so I suggest to install the most recent verstion with:

``` bash
brew install emacs
```

Or if you want a version with graphical interface, use `brew install emacs --with-cocoa`. I prefer CLI version.

## What is next?

Fist of all let me explain a bit. To comfortably read mail from Emacs you need a several programs:

1. **Emacs** itself of course.
2. **mbsync** (component of isync). This is the program that will actually fetch emails from your Imap server (for gmail it is `imap.gmail.com`). The purpose of this program is to syncronize and maintain local email database.
3. **mu**. This is a CLI (not Emacs yet) program for reading mail. You have database, but you need something to read it, so you use Mu. Mu lets you easily (and powerfully) search through your emails and find the data you want.
4. **mu4e**. This is an Emacs mode, that basically allows you to use Mu inside Emacs.
5. **smtpmail**. This is another Emacs mode, that allows you to sends emails to other people (or yourself :)).

Pretty complicated, right? Well, welcome to Emacs.

## Installing isync

Installing isync is pretty easy with Homebrew. Just use the following comand:

``` bash
brew install isync
```

## Configuring mbsync

### .mbsyncrc

To setup mbsync create a file `.mbsyncrc` in your home location. For Gmail you can use the following configuration:

```
IMAPAccount gmail
Host imap.gmail.com
User <YOUR_ACCOUNT@gmail.com>
PassCmd "gpg -q --for-your-eyes-only --no-tty -d ~/.mbsyncpass.gpg"
Port 993
SSLType IMAPS
AuthMechs Login
CertificateFile /usr/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem

IMAPStore gmail-remote
Account gmail

MaildirStore gmail-local
Path ~/email/gmail/
Inbox ~/email/gmail/INBOX

Channel gmail-inbox
Master :gmail-remote:
Slave :gmail-local:
Patterns "INBOX"

Channel gmail-sent
Master :gmail-remote:"[Gmail]/Sent Mail"
Slave :gmail-local:sent

Channel gmail-trash
Master :gmail-remote:"[Gmail]/Trash"
Slave :gmail-local:trash

Group gmail
Channel gmail-inbox
Channel gmail-sent
Channel gmail-trash
```

Do not forget to change `<YOUR_ACCOUNT@gmail.com>` with you account at gmail.com.

### Install GPG

You will need GPG to encript password. If you don't have it, just issue a command for Homebrew:

``` bash
brew install gpg
```

### .mbsyncpass

Then you should create a file containing your password. To make it safer we will encrypt it using GPG.

1. Create a temprorary file `~/.mbsyncpass` with your plain text password inside.
2. Use the following command to encrypt it with password.
``` bash
gpg --output ~/.mbsyncpass.gpg --symmetric .mbsyncpass
```
3. Remove `.mbsyncpass` file.

### Mail directories

Create directories for mail databases using following commands:
``` bash
mkdir ~/email
mkdir ~/email/gmail
```

### Trying syncronization

To sync all inboxes execute the following command:
``` bash
mbsync -a
```

You will be prompted for password, then a syncronization should start:
``` bash
$ mbsync -a
C: 0/3  B: 0/3  M: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0  S: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0
Maildir notice: no UIDVALIDITY, creating new.
C: 0/3  B: 0/3  M: +0/0 *23/23 #0/0  S: +85/7229 *0/0 #0/0
```

You can see the current progress `S: +85/7229` -- that means that 85 emails from 7230 is processed.

## Installing Mu

The next step is to install mu itself. But because of an Homebrew issue you should first install `mono`. Use the following command:
``` bash
brew install mono
```

Now you can install mu with Emacs (or mu4e). Use the following command:
``` bash
brew install mu --with-emacs
```

Unfortunately this installation will not work with Emacs installed from Cask, so I suggest to install Emacs with regular Homebrew, it works perfectly.

## Configuring Mu

In a meantime lets check on your syncronization status. Probably a couple more minutes to wait. When it is ready you should let Mu index the mail directory with a following command:
``` bash
mu index --maildir=~/email/gmail/
```

Then you should set up your Mu4e. Add following rows to your ~/.emacs file:
``` elisp
(require 'smtpmail)

; smtp
(setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
      smtpmail-starttls-credentials
      '(("smtp.gmail.com" 587 nil nil))
      smtpmail-default-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com"
      smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com"
      smtpmail-smtp-service 587
      smtpmail-debug-info t)

(require 'mu4e)

(setq mu4e-maildir (expand-file-name "~/email/gmail"))

(setq mu4e-drafts-folder "/Drafts")
(setq mu4e-sent-folder   "/Sent Mail")
(setq mu4e-trash-folder  "/Trash")

(setq message-signature-file "~/.emacs.d/.signature") ; put your signature in this file

; get mail
(setq mu4e-get-mail-command "mbsync -c ~/.mbsyncrc gmail"
      mu4e-html2text-command "w3m -T text/html"
      mu4e-update-interval 120
      mu4e-headers-auto-update t
      mu4e-compose-signature-auto-include nil)

;; show images
(setq mu4e-show-images t)

;; use imagemagick, if available
(when (fboundp 'imagemagick-register-types)
  (imagemagick-register-types))

;; general emacs mail settings; used when composing e-mail
;; the non-mu4e-* stuff is inherited from emacs/message-mode
(setq mu4e-reply-to-address "<YOUR_ACCONT@GMAIL.COM>"
    user-mail-address "<YOUR_ACCOUNT@GMAIL.COM>"
    user-full-name  "<YOUR FULL NAME>")
```

## Using Mu4e

Finally you are (almost) done! You can try launching Mu4e in Emacs by executing the following command `M-x mu4e`. If you lost inside mu4e press `q` to return back to `*mu4e-main*`.
