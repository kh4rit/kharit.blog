As a consultant for enterprise software, I work a lot with documentation.
When software is as complicated as something like ERP system, and so
many people are working on it at the same time, you have to have a robust
documentation for your projet. The most common solution I found is using
a SharePoint with Word files on it. So using a **shared folder** with
documents, managed in application, main point of which is to create
printed documents. It means that you have to think about formating every
time you write something.

And we don't care about formatting at all when we write documentation.
What we care is the content. These documents are never printed after all.

There are other things we care about that require something more suitable
than a shared folder with rich text files in it.

I didn't find anything suitable on the market, so I decided to write it
myself.

Among keys features for application I defined the following:
1. There should be no need to think about style. Identation, header
   size, layout, paging and othey styling should be managed by the
   application.
2. Repeating text should be easily readable everywhere and maintained
   in a single place.
