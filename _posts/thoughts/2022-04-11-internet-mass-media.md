When I was younger I was very critical. I stopped watching TV as I didn't like
political propaganda and ads. There are people who controlled what I consumed
on TV. When I was watching it, I unconcsiously followed their agenda (good or
bad). I came to conclusion this is not for me: I need to make my own choices,
choose what news and shows I consume.

It was kind of rebel behaviour at the time. I was still following some
alternative channels, that were not mainstream. Mostly on internet. Something
like a social network or an online video-sharing platform.

Even now people sometimes find strange that I don't have TV, although surely I
am not alone anymore.

Recent events made me think: what is the difference between modern-day YouTube
and the old TV? Both have censorship, both are used for propaganda, both are
trying to control me. YouTube actually is the modern-day TV. Governments and
corporations mastered how to propagate their products and ideas on the
platforms like Twitter and YouTube.

In reality I am following the same path my parents did. They were controlled
via TV, I am controlled via other mass media, â€” yet again history repeats
itself.

Most prominently you can see youself being controlled during the current times.
Truth is the first casualty... You can see censorship, you can see the single
view being translated. It became obvious who controls which channels.

Quite some time ago I left Instagram. I actually did it based on a suggestion
from Elon Musk ðŸ™ƒ, who (in an episode of Joe Rogan podcast) suggested, that
deleting Instagram makes people happier.

Did it make me happier? I don't think so, --- at least I didn't notice it. But
I like some changes it caused in my life, so I will not get it back.

In a similar way I believe that quitting YouTube and Twitter will make some
good changes in my life. It is better to spend my time creating/learging
something new or reading a 50+ year old book, that is still popular today.
